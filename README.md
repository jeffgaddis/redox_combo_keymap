# Jeff Gaddis's Redox Keymap
To be inserted in ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/redox/keymaps/jg-combos

The full combo list is saved here and you can add more to use like a steno keyboard if you compile for a RP2040 with enough space: https://github.com/jeffgaddis/QMK_Combo_Generator

## Keymap Features
This Redox keymap uses Colemack-DH and emphasizes single key press actions instead of holding down keys. A QWERTY layer is also available (good for sharing the keyboard with other people).

The combos used with this keyboard were calculated to be the most effecient using this generator: https://github.com/jeffgaddis/QMK_Combo_Generator/

## Other Recommendations
This is my keyboard for traveling or working in the office. When I am at home I prefer to use my Dactyl Manuform along with a Super16 macro pad with 2 rotary encoders.

## Referanced work
- I used Preconditions keymap for a over 1 year and took ideas like combos and Caps Word from it. I decided that I do not like homerow mods due to accidental inputs and because switching to one shot mods removes the need to hold down keys which can cause RSI.

- I regularly referance http://xahlee.info/ to decide what the most effecient/least effort layouts and techniques are.
